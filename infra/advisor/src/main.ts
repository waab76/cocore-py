//   * `GET /providers` — debug list of who's online.
//   * `POST /jobs`     — Phase 2.5: requester submits a sealed

// State stays in-memory: ProviderRegistry tracks who's connected
// and live; SessionManager tracks who's awaiting an SSE relay.
// Both are lost on restart — providers reconnect automatically;
