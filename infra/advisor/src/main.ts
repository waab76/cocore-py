//                        InferenceChunk / InferenceComplete back to
//                        whichever requester opened the dispatch.
//   * `GET /healthz`   — Railway healthcheck.
//   * `GET /providers` — debug list of who's online.
//   * `POST /jobs`     — Phase 2.5: requester submits a sealed
//                        prompt, advisor picks an attested provider,
//                        forwards `inference_request`, and streams

//
// State stays in-memory: ProviderRegistry tracks who's connected
// and live; SessionManager tracks who's awaiting an SSE relay.
// Both are lost on restart — providers reconnect automatically;
// in-flight requesters retry.
