// In-memory dispatch sessions. Each `POST /jobs` opens an SSE
// connection back to the requester and creates a session keyed by
// the `session_id` we forward to the chosen provider. When the
// provider streams `inference_chunk` and `inference_complete` frames
// back, the WS handler looks up the session here and writes
// `data: <json>\n\n` lines to the SSE response. The session ends
// (and the SSE response closes) on the first `inference_complete`,
// or on a configurable idle timeout.
//
// Like the rest of the advisor, this is in-memory only. A Phase 3
// rewrite will move sessions into Redis or similar so dispatch
// survives advisor restarts; for v0 a redeploy just disconnects
// in-flight requesters and they retry.
