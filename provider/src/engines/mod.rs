//! Inference-engine abstraction.
//!
//! `cocore agent serve` ships a stub engine by default — it echoes the
//! prompt with metadata, enough to wire-test the protocol but not to
//! actually answer anything. To serve real inference the agent spawns
//! one `SubprocessEngine` per configured model (see `subprocess.rs`).
//! Each instance owns a Python child process that hosts `vllm-mlx`'s
//! FastAPI app on a Unix domain socket; the Rust side proxies
//! `/v1/chat/completions` over the socket using a hand-rolled
//! HTTP/1.1 client.
//!
//! The v0.5.x in-process PyO3 design (and the `inference` feature
//! flag that gated it) is gone. PyO3+auto-initialize baked the build
//! machine's libpython path into the binary's Mach-O load commands,
//! which crashed dyld on every user whose Mac didn't have Homebrew
//! Python 3.12 at exactly `/opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.12/...`. The
//! subprocess design has zero libpython linkage and runs unchanged
//! across Macs whose Python toolchain came from python.org, brew,
//! conda, Xcode CLT, or — with the v0.6+ installer — `uv`-managed
//! python-build-standalone.
//!
//! The trait sits between the advisor's `handle_inference_request`
//! and whichever backend is in scope. It keeps three concerns local
//! to the engine implementation:
//!
//!   1. Tokenization (real engines use the model's tokenizer; stub
//!      uses estimate_tokens).
//!   2. Generation (real engines spawn a subprocess and proxy
//!      requests; stub builds a string).
//!   3. Model lifecycle (real engines load once + reuse across
//!      requests; stub has no state).
