//! Advisor client: outbound WebSocket from the provider to a federated
//! matchmaking service. The advisor wraps requester prompts to the
//! provider's X25519 key and forwards them; the advisor never sees
//! plaintext, never holds a receipt, and never gets to invalidate one.
//!
//! Phase 2.5+: handles InferenceRequest end-to-end — decrypts the
//! sealed prompt, streams token deltas back to the requester as they
//! are produced, publishes a `dev.cocore.compute.receipt` to our PDS
//! when we have enough strong-refs, and emits InferenceComplete whose
//! `receipt_uri` carries the published `at://`.

// Hot serve path: a panic here can poison shared state or (before the
// per-job catch_unwind boundary) take the whole agent down — the exact
// escalation that took machines offline. Deny the panic-on-the-happy-path
// footguns in production builds; the `#[cfg(test)]` module below is exempt
// (tests legitimately use `unwrap`/`expect`/`panic!`).
