//! Wire types for advisor ↔ provider WebSocket messages.
//!
//! The advisor is stateless w.r.t. receipts (anything that matters for
//! authority lives on a PDS), but we still need a transport for: provider
//! registration, heartbeats, encrypted job dispatch, and inference
//! progress. Frames are tagged JSON (`#[serde(tag = "type", rename_all =
//! "snake_case")]`) so the wire is human-debuggable and version-tolerant —
//! receivers can ignore unknown variants without dropping the connection.
