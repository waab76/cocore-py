//! Production-side counterpart to [`mda`].
//!
//! Where `mda.rs` verifies a cert chain, this module *produces* one
//! to embed in a fresh `dev.cocore.compute.attestation` record.
//!
//! Three acquisition strategies, tried in order:
//!
//!   1. **`COCORE_MDA_CERT_CHAIN_PATH`** — path to a PEM file
//!      containing one or more `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----` blocks.
//!      Leaf cert first, then any intermediates, in the order
//!      `mda::verify_chain` expects (cert[i] signed by cert[i+1],
//!      top-of-chain signed by Apple's Enterprise Attestation Root
//!      CA). This is the operator-managed flow: an MDM agent or a
//!      one-shot Swift helper writes the chain to disk and the
//!      Rust agent picks it up at boot.
//!
//!   2. **`COCORE_MDA_CHAIN_URL`** — a coordinator URL the Secure
//!      Mode wizard provisions per device (the device serial baked
//!      into the query string). At each refresh we `curl` it; the
//!      response is either a raw PEM chain or JSON
//!      `{"chain": ["<pem>", …] | null}` (the shape the console's
//!      `/api/agent/mdm/attestation-chain` endpoint returns once step-ca
//!      has captured the device's Apple attestation). A `null`/absent
//!      chain is "not captured yet" → empty, not an error.
//!
//!   3. **`COCORE_MDA_ATTEST_BINARY`** — path to an executable. On
//!      each attestation refresh we invoke it with no arguments,
//!      pipe its stdout (expected: PEM-formatted chain), parse the
//!      blocks. Exit code 0 = success; non-zero or empty stdout =
//!      treated as "no chain available." stderr is captured but
//!      not logged (it may contain device-identifying material).
//!      This is the dynamic flow we'll use once the Swift companion
//!      `cocore-mda-attest` ships — that binary will call
//!      `DCAppAttestService` / DeviceCheck APIs and emit the chain
//!      Apple signs on the spot.
//!
//! ## BINDING CONTRACT (load-bearing) — RESOLVED: freshness-code (option b)
//!
//! Whichever flow produces the chain, it **MUST bind to this agent's
//! receipt-signing P-256 key** (the `SigningIdentity` public key — the
//! same value published as the attestation's `publicKey`), or a genuine
//! Apple chain for an unrelated device could be stapled onto this signer.
//! Two bindings are accepted (see `mda::MdaResult::binds_key`):
//!
//!   - **(a)** the attested leaf key IS the signing key
//!     (`leaf.publicKey == attestation.publicKey`), or
//!   - **(b)** the **freshness-code** binding (the chosen path): the leaf's
//!     Apple freshness OID commits to the signing key —
//!     `freshness_code == sha256(signing pubkey)`. The agent keeps its own
//!     stable signing identity; the enrollment flow sets the attestation's
//!     freshness / `clientDataHash` to that hash. The verifier recomputes
//!     it offline from `publicKey` alone.
//!
//! `attestation::build` enforces the same on the way out — it drops any
//! chain that doesn't verify Apple-rooted AND bind to the signing key (by
//! either rule), staying self-attested rather than publishing an unbacked
//! hardware claim.
//!
//! If both env vars are set, the file path wins (lets operators
//! pin a chain across binary upgrades without re-attesting).
//!
//! Failure mode for a missing or malformed chain: return `Ok(empty)`,
//! NOT `Err`. The agent should keep running with a self-attested
//! posture rather than refusing to boot — the attestation record's
//! `mdaCertChain` field is optional and the AppView's verifier
//! already treats absent chains as "self-attested." Hard errors
//! here would create an operational footgun where a bad path turns
//! into an outage. The diagnostic goes through tracing instead.
//!
//! ## Why this can't be pure Rust today
//!
//! The cert chain has to be signed by Apple. The signing path runs
//! through:
//!
//! - **App Attest** (`DCAppAttestService`, `DeviceCheck.framework`)
//!   — produces an attestation rooted at Apple's App Attest CA.
//!   Requires a code-signed app with the App Attest entitlement
//!   (`com.apple.developer.devicecheck.appattest-environment`) +
//!   Apple Developer Program membership.
//!
//! - **Managed Device Attestation** (MDM-mediated, RFC 8555 ACME
//!   `device-attest-01`) — produces an attestation rooted at
//!   Apple's Enterprise Attestation Root CA (which `mda.rs`
//!   already embeds). Requires an MDM enrolled device + an MDM
//!   server that requests attestation via ACME.
//!
//! Either way, a Swift / Objective-C binary linked against
//! Apple's framework is the only supported way to drive these
//! APIs from user space. That binary is tracked as a separate
//! deliverable; this module's contract is "if you can get a
//! chain into a file or stdout, the agent will pick it up."
