# WS-AGENT-SIGNING: sign + notarize the `cocore` worker agent so its cdhash is a
# real, OS-enforced, measurable identity (today the worker was spawned ad-hoc
# and unsigned, making its cdhash meaningless and the confidential tier
# impossible).
#
# This is what produces a binary whose live `csops` read (codesign::read_self)
# reports hardenedRuntime + libraryValidation + getTaskAllow=false — the posture
# the confidential verifier requires. The resulting cdhash is what a release
# adds to the advisor's / requesters' known-good set.
#
# Usage:
#   COCORE_SIGN_IDENTITY="Developer ID Application: NAME (TEAMID)" \
#   [COCORE_NOTARY_PROFILE=cocore-notary] \
#   provider/scripts/sign-and-notarize.sh path/to/cocore [path/to/mlx.metallib]
#
# Notarization is skipped unless COCORE_NOTARY_PROFILE names a stored
# `notarytool` keychain profile (set up once with
# `xcrun notarytool store-credentials`). Signing always runs.
