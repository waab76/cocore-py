cocore inference subprocess wrapper.

The Rust agent (`cocore agent serve`) spawns one instance of this
script per model it wants to serve. The script loads vllm-mlx, binds
its FastAPI app to a Unix domain socket, and serves until the parent
sends SIGTERM *or* the parent goes away.

The second condition is a hard failsafe. An explicit SIGTERM is the
clean teardown path, but it is not the only one the parent can take:
the agent can be SIGKILLed, crash, get `launchctl kickstart -k`'d, or
exit non-gracefully on a trust-tier / model switch (`std::process::exit`
skips Rust destructors), and an uninstall removes the app without
signalling its children at all. In every one of those cases this child
would otherwise reparent to launchd (PPID 1) and run forever, holding
hundreds of MB of RAM on a socket nobody can reach. So a daemon thread
watches the parent PID and exits this process the moment the parent is
gone — see `_start_parent_death_watch`. The agent cannot leak us.

Why a subprocess and not in-process PyO3:
  * The Rust binary stays free of libpython linkage — `otool -L
    /usr/local/bin/cocore` shows only system frameworks, so the
    binary runs unchanged on any macOS arm64 regardless of which
    Python (if any) the user has installed system-wide.
  * Python crashes (vllm-mlx segfault, OOM kill, Metal-layer panic)
    kill only this child. The agent restarts it on the next request
    and keeps publishing receipts in the meantime.
  * Model swap = kill + respawn, no daemon restart.

Why Unix domain sockets and not TCP localhost:
  * No port-allocation race or collision risk.
  * File-mode 0600 on the socket gives access control by uid, so a
    different local user can't hit our inference engine.
  * Slightly faster (no TCP stack).

Usage (the agent calls this; users don't):
  cocore_inference_server.py --model <hf-id> --uds <socket-path>

The script writes a single line `READY` to stdout once the model is
loaded and the socket is bound — the parent watches for this so it
knows when to call `engine.ready() = true`.
