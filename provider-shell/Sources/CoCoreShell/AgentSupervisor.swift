// AgentSupervisor: controls the `cocore` Rust agent. The agent is the
// only thing that ever decrypts a prompt; the Swift app sees no
// inference data.
//
// Two modes, chosen at runtime:
//
//   * Installed machine — a `dev.cocore.provider` LaunchAgent already
//     owns the long-running `cocore agent serve` process (RunAtLoad +
//     KeepAlive). We must NOT spawn our own, or two agents fight over
//     the same session. So start/stop/serving status all go through
//     `launchctl` against that label.
//
//   * Dev (`swift run`, no LaunchAgent installed) — fall back to
//     spawning + monitoring the binary ourselves so the app is still
//     useful in a working tree.
//
// Binary discovery (for the dev-spawn fallback + the pair flow):
//   1. $COCORE_PROVIDER_BIN (developer override)
//   2. <Bundle>/Contents/MacOS/cocore (release builds bundle it)
//   3. ~/.local/bin/cocore (the standard installer location)
//   4. <repo>/provider/target/release/cocore (dev `swift run`)
