# Build the cocore menu-bar app (provider-shell) into a real .app
# bundle WITHOUT Xcode.
#
# The provider-shell README's release path assumes Xcode (archive +
# notarize + Developer ID). That's right for distribution, but it
# makes day-to-day "does the tray icon actually show up" verification
# painful, and it's overkill for local installs. This script assembles
# a double-clickable, ad-hoc-signed bundle straight from `swift build`,
# so `swift`-only machines (Command Line Tools, no full Xcode) can run
# the app.
#
# Output: provider-shell/build/cocore.app
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/build-mac-app.sh              # release build
#   CONFIG=debug ./scripts/build-mac-app.sh # faster debug build
#   OPEN=1 ./scripts/build-mac-app.sh       # build then launch it
#
# SECURE / NATIVE build (WS-A, opt-in):
#   COCORE_BUILD_NATIVE=1 ./scripts/build-mac-app.sh
#
#   The DEFAULT build ships the subprocess inference engine (Python venv
#   over a UDS). That path cannot serve the confidential tier: the
#   plaintext leaves the measured, signed `cocore` binary. Setting
#   COCORE_BUILD_NATIVE=1 instead builds with `--features native_mlx`, so
#   the binary contains the in-process MLX engine (libCoCoreMLX.dylib +
#   precompiled mlx.metallib) and `inProcessBackend` can become true. This
#   path REQUIRES the Metal toolchain (full Xcode, not just Command Line
#   Tools) because provider/build.rs runs `swift build` of the MLX engine.
#   It is hardened-signed + notarized exactly like the default path.
#
#   After a native build you MUST extract its cdHash and register it as
#   known-good, or the confidential tier silently downgrades to
#   best-effort. See scripts/extract-cdhash.sh, scripts/register-known-good.sh,
#   and docs/secure-release.md.
