# Configure a Railway per-PR preview environment so it self-references.
#
# Railway clones each PR environment (`cocore-pr-<N>`) from `production`, which
# uses custom domains (console.cocore.dev / cocore.dev). So a fresh clone points
# its public URLs + service DID at PROD and is missing the new-code gating vars
# (COCORE_APPVIEW_DID, COCORE_ADVISOR_URL, the internal secret, the AppView's
# OAuth key). We can't fix this by converting production to ${{ RAILWAY_* }}
# reference variables — that would break prod's custom domains. Instead this
# script rewrites the PR env's vars to its OWN deterministic Railway domains
# (`<service>-cocore-pr-<N>.up.railway.app`) and copies/fills the shared
# secrets, then redeploys. Idempotent — safe to re-run on every push.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/configure-pr-env.sh <pr-number>
#   PR_NUMBER=26 ./scripts/configure-pr-env.sh
#
# Auth: uses the ambient Railway login (your CLI session locally, or
# RAILWAY_API_TOKEN in CI). Needs access to the project's PR environments.
